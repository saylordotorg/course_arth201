-   **Unit 1: The Art of Ancient Egypt**  

    *This unit focuses on the art, architecture, and archaeology of
    ancient Egypt from the Early Dynastic* *(c. 3100-2650 BCE)**through
    the Roman (30 BCE- 4<sup>th</sup> century CE) periods. It begins
    with an overview of the major characteristics of Egyptian art,
    mythology, and beliefs about the afterlife, and ancient Egyptian
    conceptions of kingship all of which remained amazingly stable for
    three millennia. The unit then focuses on major Egyptian monuments,
    tombs, and artistic developments, following the chronology
    established by the reign of Egyptian kings.*  
       
     *After completing this unit, you will be able to identify the major
    characteristics of ancient Egyptian art and architecture and the
    most important ancient Egyptian monuments, tombs, and art objects.
    You will also be able to tell how famous sites, such as the Great
    Temple at Karnak, and more common objects, such as the thousands of
    coffins recovered from Egyptian tombs, can be used to examine
    ancient Egyptian history and culture.*
