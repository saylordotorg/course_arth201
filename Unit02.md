-   **Unit 2: The Art of the Ancient Near East**  

    *This unit focuses on the art, architecture, and archaeology of the
    Ancient Near East, from the late Neolithic (c. 9500-4500 BCE) until
    the defeat of the Achaemenid Persian Empire (550–330 BCE) by
    Alexander the Great. It begins by examining the art and architecture
    associated with the urban revolution in Mesopotamia and then focuses
    on the art and architecture of the various empires and military
    powers based in Mesopotamia and Anatolia in the third-first
    millennium BCE.*  
       
     *After completing this unit, you will be able to identify the major
    characteristics of ancient Near Eastern art and architecture, the
    important role that city, temple, palace, and monument building
    played in definitions of ancient Near Eastern kingship, as well as
    how successive rulers adopted and adapted the art forms and
    architectural programs of their predecessors.*
