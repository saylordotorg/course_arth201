Course Syllabus for "ARTH201: Art of Ancient Egypt and the Ancient Near East"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This course serves as an introduction to the major artistic and
architectural traditions of Ancient Egypt and the Ancient Near East.
This course will explore how artifacts and monuments can be used to
study the history and culture of the ancient world. It is divided into
two units that chronologically focus on the art, architecture, and
archaeology of each region. The first unit examines Ancient Egyptian
tombs, monuments, and art from the Early Dynastic (c. 3100-2650 BCE)
through the Roman (30 BCE- 4<sup>th</sup>century CE) periods. The second
unit focuses on Ancient Near Eastern artistic and architectural
traditions from the late Neolithic (c. 9500-4500 BCE) through the
conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire (550-330 BCE) by Alexander the
Great. After completing this course, you will be able to identify the
major characteristics of Egyptian and Near Eastern art and architecture,
more specifically what types of objects and buildings were made and used
by Egyptians and Ancient Near Eastern peoples. You will also learn how
ancient artifacts and monuments in particular, as well as art objects in
general, can be used to understand larger political, cultural,
religious, and economic structures.
